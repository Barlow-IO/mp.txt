Literally a text based adventure

# Prerequisites

 1. [**`node.js`**](https://nodejs.org/download/)

 2. **`npm`** - node package manager (this was also installed in the previous package)

#How to use

 1. Clone this repository

 2. run `npm install -g nodemon`  
    (if you have problems with this step, use `sudo` at the beginning of the command)

 3. run `cd /path/to/this/repo`

 4. run `npm install`

 5. run `nodemon .`

 6. open a browser and go to `localhost:3001`

Any time you save changes to code, `nodemon` will update the server.
Just refresh, and you're good to go.
